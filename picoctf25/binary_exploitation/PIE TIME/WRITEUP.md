## ðŸ§¾ Overview

This challenge gave us a 64-bit PIE-enabled ELF binary named `vuln`. When executed, it prints the address of `main()` and prompts the user to enter an address to jump to. The goal is to calculate the address of a hidden `win()` function and redirect execution to it to get the flag.

---

## âœ… Solution

I started by checking the function offsets in the binary using `objdump`:

```bash
objdump -t vuln | grep main
```

**Output:**
```
000000000000133d g     F .text 00000000000000cc              main
```

Then I checked `win()`:

```bash
objdump -t vuln | grep win
```

**Output:**
```
00000000000012a7 g     F .text 0000000000000096              win
```

This showed that `win()` is located 0x96 bytes (150 in decimal) before `main()`.

The binary prints the runtime address of `main()` on each execution. When I connected to the remote challenge:

```bash
$ nc rescued-float.picoctf.net 53836
```

It displayed:

```
Address of main: 0x5d308662e33d
Enter the address to jump to, ex => 0x12345:
```

To find the address of `win()`, I subtracted the offset:

```bash
python3 -c "print(hex(0x5d308662e33d - 0x96))"
```

**Output:**
```
0x5d308662e2a7
```

I entered that value:

```
0x5d308662e2a7
```

And got:

```
You won!
picoCTF{b4s1c_p051t10n_1nd3p3nd3nc3_ecb96bdd}
