## ðŸ§¾ Overview

This challenge gave us a file called `red.png`, which initially appeared to be a plain red square. However, the repetitive emphasis on "RED" and the reference to poetry hinted that there might be hidden data embedded in the image. The goal was to extract the flag hidden using steganography.

---

## âœ… Solution

I began by inspecting the file using `exiftool`:

```bash
exiftool red.png
```

Among the standard metadata, there was a custom field labeled `Poem` containing a red-themed poem. This wasnâ€™t typical and suggested that the image may contain steganographic content.

I opened the image in CyberChef to further analyze it:

- Loaded the `red.png` file into CyberChef as input.
- Applied the `Extract LSB` operation.
  - Colour Pattern #1: R
  - Colour Pattern #2: G
  - Colour Pattern #3: B
  - Colour Pattern #4: A
  - Pixel Order: Row
  - Bit: 0
- This produced a long string of base64-like data in the output.
- Then I added the `From Base64` operation with the following settings:
  - Alphabet: A-Za-z0-9+/=
  - Remove non-alphabet chars: Checked
  - Strict mode: Unchecked

The decoded output revealed the flag, repeated 100 times:
