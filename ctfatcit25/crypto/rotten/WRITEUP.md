## üßæ Overview

The challenge just gave this:

```
PVG{LxxdJwAXJGcsDoncKfRctddA}
```

I noticed the flag started with PVG{}, but all the flags for this CTF use CIT{}, so I figured something was up. The challenge name was ‚Äúrotten,‚Äù which immediately made me think of ROT13. I checked if PVG turns into CIT with a ROT13 shift ‚Äî it did, so that confirmed it.

## ‚úÖ Solution

I pasted the whole string into CyberChef and ran the ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù operation. It decoded cleanly to:

```
CIT{YkkqWjNKWTpfQbapXsepqqN}
```
